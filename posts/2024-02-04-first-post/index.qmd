#### FoolsFest 2024 kicked off in style with a Town Hall call for questions, answers and getting excited!

#### We talked about the things that makes FoolsFest unique, the expansiveness of this canvas, inclusivity for all types of fools, building community,  logistical questions, the production of a FoolsFest festival guide, sources of inspiration, and  fun & games.

#### Participants on the call shared that they were excited for Silliness in Nature, Connecting Through Foolishness, Creative Expression, Reconnecting and New Encounters, Unique Contributions...and Chalk(!)

#### **Here's how you can continue the planning conversation. Check out and contribute to:**
